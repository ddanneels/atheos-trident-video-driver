## INSTALLATION


Binary:
1. Copy the objs/trident executable into /system/drivers/appserver/video.
2. Ensure that the file has read and execute permissions.

Sources:
1. Get the Atheos system source tree. Uncompress it wherever you want.
2. In the source tree, go to: "system/appserver/drivers/video/".
3. Uncompress trident driver. This should create a trident directory.
4. Enter the "trident" directory.
5. Type "make". This wil create the trident binary into objs/
6. Type "make install" to copy the driver onto your system.



## CREATE AN ATHEOS BOOT DISK


To create an atheos boot disk containing the trident driver, you must have
a running Atheos box.

Mount the second installation floppy disk. You will see a "bimage2.bin.gz"
file. Copy it on your hard disk. Unzip it. Mount it (with "-t ramfs").

From your mount point, go to "atheos/sys/drivers/appserver/video/".
You can now copy the trident driver (with read and execute permissions).

You can now save back your image file :
Use "makeramdisk <mount point> <destination file>" command.
Compress the new file with gzip.
Copy it back to the floppy, under the original name.

That's it.


Enjoy.
